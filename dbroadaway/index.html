              My design philosophy is user driven, simple, and pragmatic.

        <p>
          I like to know as much as possible about the target user before I
          design. That knowledge informs every aspect of my design process from
          creation through each design iteration.User research can be
          challenging. I have conducted user tests at coffee shops, getting
          quick feedback for the price of a gift card. The UX wall at a user
          conference allowed me to pull users in for a quick interview. Steve
          Krug’s DIY user testing process was part of the sprint cycle. Sales,
          customer service and support departments can always provide direct
          user feedback.

          Coco Chanel famously said, “before you leave the house, look in the
          mirror and take at least one thing off.” I take the same approach to
          UX and Product Design. Core features should be obvious and immediately
          available. Ancillary features should be easy find to but should not
          obstruct core features. Visual Design should enhance the experience
          without being disruptive. I always ask myself is this necessary,
          useful, or valuable?

          Product design must be informed by user needs, technical limitations,
          business constraints, and efficient process. As a product designer I
          put myself in the shoes of the user, the client, the developer, and
          other stakeholders as I advocate for the most pragmatic solution to a
          design problem.
